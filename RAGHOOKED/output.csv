The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin, UT, or
Texas) is a public research university in Austin, Texas. It is the
flagship institution of the University of Texas System. With
52,384 students as of Fall 2022, it is also the largest institution
in the system.[12]
Founde d in 1883, UT Austin is considered a Public Ivy. The
university is a major center for academic research, with
research expenditures totaling $1.06 billion for fiscal year
2023.[13] It joined the Association of American Universities in
1929. The university hous es seven museums and seventeen
libraries, including the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library
and the Blanton Museum of Art, and operates various auxiliary
research facilities, such as the J. J. Pickle Research Campus
and the McDonald Observatory.
Student-athletes compete as the Texas Longhor ns. The
Longhor ns have won four NCAA Division I National Football
Championships, six NCAA Division I National Baseball
Championships, thirteen NCAA Division I National Men's
Swimming and Diving Championships, and the school has
claimed more titles in men's and women's sports than any other
member in the Big 12.
As of November 2020,  13 Nobel Prize winners, over 25
Pulitzer Prize winners, three Turing Award winners, two Fields
Medal recipients, two Wolf Prize winners, and three Abel Prize
winners have been affiliated with the school as alumni, faculty
members, or researchers. The university has also been affiliated
with three Primetime Emmy Award winners, and as of 2021, its
students and alumni have earned a total of 155 Olympic
medals.[14]
The idea of a public university in Texas was first mentioned in
the 1827 constitution of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas,
which promised public education in the arts and sciences unde r

The university's Old Main building in
1903gained independence from Mexico in 1836, the Constitution of
the Republic emphasized Congress's duty, in Section 5 of its
General Provisions, to establish a general system of education
when circumstances allowed.[16]
After Texas was annexed, the Seventh Texas Legislature
passed O.B. 102 on February 11, 1858, allocating $100,000 in
United States bonds  from the Compromise of 1850  for the
University of Texas.[17][18] The Civil War delayed fund
repayment, leaving the university with only $16,000 by
1865.[19] Nevertheless, the Texas Constitution of 1876
reaffirmed the mandate to establish ""The University of Texas""
by popul ar vote.[20]
On March 30, 1881, the Texas legislature organized the
structure of the university and called for a popul ar vote to
determine its location.[21] Austin was chosen as the site with
30,913 votes, while Galveston was designated for the medical
department.[22][23] On November 17, 1882, the cornerstone of
the Old Main building was laid at the original ""College Hill""
location, and University President Ashbel Smith expressed
optimism about Texas's untapped resources.[24] The University
of Texas officially ope ned its door s on S eptember 15, 1883.[25]
The old Victorian-Gothic Main Building served as the central
point of the campus's 40-acre (16 ha) site, and was used for
nearly all purposes. But by the 1930s , discussions arose about
the need for new library space, and the Main Building was
razed in 1934, despite the objections of many students and
faculty. The modern-day tower and Main Building were
constructed in its place.[26][27]
In 1916, a contentious dispute erupted between Texas Governor
James E. Ferguson and the University of Texas over faculty
appointments. Ferguson's attempt to influence these appointments
led to a retaliatory veto of the university's budge t, jeopardizing its
operations. Subsequently, Ferguson was impeached by the Texas
House of Representatives, convicted by the Senate on charges
including misapplication of public funds , and removed from
office.[28]
In 1921, the legislature appropriated $1.35 million for the purchase
of land next to the main campus. However, expansion was hampered by the restriction against using state
revenues to fund construction of university buildings as set forth in Article 7, Section 14 of the Constitution.
With the completion of Santa Rita No. 1 well[29] and the discovery of oil on university-owned lands in
1923, the university added significantly to its Permanent University Fund. The additional income fromExpansion and growthUT Architecture LibraryPermanent University Fund investments allowed for bond issues in
1931 and 1947, which allowed the legislature to address funding
for the university along with the Agricultural and Mechanical
College (now know n as Texas A&M University). With sufficient
funds  to finance construction on both campuses, on April 8, 1931,
the Forty Second Legislature passed H.B. 368.[30] which dedicated
the Agricultural and Mechanical College a 1/3 interest in the
Available University Fund,[31] the annua l income from Permanent
University Fund i nvestments.
The University of Texas was induc ted into the Association of
American Universities in 1929.[32]
During World War II, the University of Texas was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took
part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.[33]
Additionally, to facilitate the wartime effort, academic calendars were compressed, allowing for accelerated
graduation.[34]
After Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, Houston, Texas, area teen Marion Ford had been accepted to
become one of the first Black attendees. In an interview with a reporter he announc ed his desire to try-out
for the famous Longhor n football team. The Ford Crisis would begin and all Black admissions at the time
were rescinded unt il policy could be drawn up.[35]
In the fall of 1956, the first Black students entered the university's unde rgraduate class.[36] Black students
were permitted to live in campus dorms, but were barred from campus cafeterias.[36] The University of
Texas integrated its facilities and desegregated its dormitories in 1965.[37] UT, which had had an open
admissions policy, adopted standardized testing for admissions in the mid-1950s , at least in part as a
conscious strategy to minimize the number of Black unde rgraduates, given that they were no longe r able to
simply bar their entry after the Brown decision [38]
Following growth in enrollment after World War II, the university unve iled an ambitious master plan in
1960 designed for ""10 years of growth"" that was intended to ""boost the University of Texas into the ranks
of the top state universities in the nation.""[39] In 1965, the Texas Legislature granted the university Board of
Regents to use eminent domain to purchase additional properties surroundi ng the original 40 acres
(160,000 m2). The university began buying parcels of land to the north, south, and east of the existing
campus, particularly in the Blackland neighbor hood to the east and the Brackenridge tract to the southeast,
in hope s of using the land to relocate the university's intramural fields, baseball field, tennis courts, and
parking lots.[39]
On March 6, 1967, the Sixtieth Texas Legislature changed the university's official name from ""The
University of Texas"" to ""The University of Texas at Austin"" to reflect the growth of the University of Texas
System.[40]
On Augus t 1, 1966, Texas student Charles Whitman barricaded the observation deck in the tower of the
Main Building. Armed with multiple firearms, he killed 14 people on campus, 11 from the observation deck
and below the clocks on the tower, and three more in the tower, as well as wounding two others inside the1966 shootingThe Tower, completed in 1937,

and ki lled by pol ice after they breached the tower.
After the Whitman event, the observation deck was closed until
1968 and then closed again in 1975 following a series of suicide
jumps during the 1970s . In 1999, after installation of security
fencing and other safety precautions, the tower observation deck
reopened to the public. There is a turtle pond park near the tower
dedicated to those affected by t he tragedy.
The first presidential library on a university campus was dedicated
on May 22, 1971, with former President Johns on, Lady Bird
Johns on and then-President Richard Nixon in attendance.
Constructed on the eastern side of the main campus, the Lyndon
Baines Johns on Library and Museum is one of 13 presidential
libraries administered by the National Archives and Records
Administration.
A statue of Martin Luther King Jr. was unve iled on campus in 1999
and subsequently vandalized.[41] By 2004, John Butler, a professor
at the McCombs School of Business suggested moving it to
Morehous e College, a historically black college, ""a place where he
is loved"".[41]
The University of Texas at Austin has experienced a wave of new construction recently with several
significant buildings. On April 30, 2006, the school opened the Blanton Museum of Art.[42] In August
2008, the AT&T Executive Education and Conference Center opened, with the hotel and conference center
forming part of a new gateway to the university. Also in 2008, Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium
was expanded to a seating capacity of 100,119, making it the largest stadium (by capacity) in the state of
Texas at the time.[43]
On Tuesday, September 28, 2010, a  shooting oc curred at the Perry–Castañeda Library (PCL) where student
Colton Tooley, armed with an AK-47, fired shots on his walk from Guadalupe Street to the library's front
entrance. The student ascended to the sixth floor, before killing himself. No one else was injured, except for
one sprained ankle suffered by a  female student fleeing the scene.[44]
In early 2020, following a major outbreak of the new coronavirus, the university restricted travel to Wuhan
province in China, aligning with the U.S. Department of State's recommendation.[45] By March 17, 2020,
then-UT President Gregory L. Fenves announc ed a transition to online classes for the rest of the spring
semester after 49 confirmed COVID-19 cases emerged from students' travels to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico,
during spring break.[46] Throughout  the summer, the university reported over 400 cases and its first
COVID-19-related death, a custodial worker.[47][48]
The fall 2020 semester consisted of a majority of online courses through platforms like Zoom. On August 6,
2020, UT Austin initiated plans for free COVID-19 tests for all students. UT Austin returned to primarily
in-person classes and campus activities for the fall 2021 semester, implementing safety protocols like testingRecent historyA police group has arrested a

In January 2023 the university blocked access to social media platform TikTok on its network in
compliance with Governor Greg Abbott's directive prohibiting the use of the app on state-managed
electronic resources due to concerns about data security and ties to the Chinese gove rnment. The
university's action aligned with similar measures taken by ot her institutions and state gove rnments across the
U.S.[50][51]
In 2024, after four years of test-optional admissions for unde rgraduate applications due to the COVID-19
pandemic, standardized testing scores were once again made a mandatory part of admissions, beginning
with applications for the Fall 2025 semester.[52] Jay Hartzell commented that the SAT and ACT
standardized exams were ""a proven differentiator that is in each student's and the University's best
interest.""[52]
On April 2, 2024, the University of Texas at Austin announc ed additional adjustments in compliance with
Senate Bill 17,[53] particularly in respons e to a letter from March 26, 2024 from Texas State Senator
Brandon Creighton,[54] which led to the layoff of approximately 60 individuals, most of whom formerly
worked in DEI-related programs, and the elimination of the newly-renamed Division of Campus and
Community Engagement.[55] Students, faculty, staff, and outside critics denounc ed the university's over-
compliance with the anti-DEI law, since the university had already been compliant since January 1,
2024.[56][57] At a UT Austin Faculty Counc il meeting on April 15, 2024, in response to mounting criticism,
President Jay Hartzell stated the additional changes were made in response to the threats from the
Republican-led State Legislature and the University of Texas System Board of Regents, and to restore
""confidence"" in the university, reacting to changing tides in public opinion towards higher education
amongs t Republicans.[58] The university's Division of Campus and Community Engagement operated the
University of Texas-University Charter School, a charter school system with 23 campuses across Texas,
until the closure on April 2, 2024, l eading the charter school to be moved to the College of Education.[59]
A large student and faculty Pro-Palestinian protest occurred on
April 24, 2024, demanding a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas War and
that the university divest from companies profiting from Israel's
actions.[60] The protests occurred amidst the ongoi ng nationwide
demonstrations on c ollege campuses.[61][62]
In respons e, the university, unde r the explicit direction of President
Hartzell,[63][64] requested the assistance of the Austin Police
Department (APD) and the Texas Department of Public Safety
(DPS), in coordination with Texas Governor Greg Abbott, in an
attempt to quell said protests and an ""occupation"" of the
university,[65][66] in contrast to free speech on campus laws praised
by Abbott and the university in prior years.[67] The deployment of
multiple police units led to the confirmed arrest of 57 protesters, including a photojournalist for Fox 7
Austin, with several more detained.[68][69][70][71][72] Charges were then dismissed against 46 protesters the
next day, leading to their subsequent release,[73][60][74] with the charges against the remaining 11 protesters
droppe d on April 26, 2024.[75]2024 Pro-Palestinian ProtestsInterior lobby of the Lyndon B
Johnson Presidential Library and
MuseumThis decision received sharp backlash, including from general faculty, staff, students, several Democratic
legislators for the region, and First Amendment advocacy groups,[76][77] including an official statement
from the UT Faculty Counc il Executive Committee denounc ing it,[78] in part due to the extreme, chaotic,
and violent police respons e that ensued and alleged violations of First Amendment rights.[79][68] The
university additionally set new rules for protests on campus, such as banning masks and face coverings and
instituting a 10 PM curfew for all protests, directly contradicting prior guidelines.[80] Initially, the university
told students and faculty that arrested protestors would no longe r be allowed on campus, but retracted the
statement two hours later, stating that they would be allowed ""academic"" access, only to then announc e a
change to full access for university affiliates.[81] Additionally, the university temporarily suspended the
student organization that organized the protests, the Palestine Solidarity Committee.[82] Travis County
Attorney Delia Garza stated that the way that the university handled the protests put a strain on the local
criminal justice system, specifically reprimanding the sending of  protestors to jail for low-level charges.[83]
The university's property totals 1,438.5 a cres (582.1 ha ), comprising the 423.5 a cres (171.4 ha ) for the Main
Campus in central Austin and the J. J. Pickle Research Campus in north Austin and the other properties
throughout  Texas. The main campus has 150 buildings totaling over 18,000,000 square feet
(1,700,000 m2).
One of the university's most visible features is the Beaux-Arts Main
Building, including a 307-foot (94 m) tower designed by Paul
Philippe Cret.[84] Completed in 1937 , the Main Building is in the
middle of campus. The tower usually appears illuminated in white
light in the evening but is lit burnt orange for various special
occasions, including athletic victories and academic
accomplishments; conve rsely, it is darkened for solemn
occasions.[85] At the top of the tower is a carillon of 56 bells, the
largest in Texas. Songs  are played on weekdays by student
carillonne urs,[86] in addition to the usual pealing of Westminster
Quarters every quarter-hour between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m.[87] In 1998,
after the installation of security and safety measures, the observation
deck reopened to the publ ic indefinitely for weekend tours.[88]
The university's seven museums and seventeen libraries hold over nine million volumes, making it the
seventh-largest academic library in the country.[89] The holdings of the university's Harry Ransom
Humanities Research Center include one of only 21 remaining complete copies of the Gutenberg Bible and
the first permanent photograph, View from the Window  at Le Gras, taken by Nicéphore Niépce.[90] The
newest museum, the 155,000- square-foot (14,400 m2) Blanton Museum of Art, is the largest university art
museum in the United States and hosts approximately 17,000 works from Europe, the United States, and
Latin America.[91][92] The Perry–Castañeda Library, which houses the central University Libraries
operations and the Perry–Castañeda Library Map Collection, is at the heart of campus. The Benson Latin
American Collection holds the largest collection of Latin American materials among US university
libraries,[93] and m aintains substantial digital collections.[94]CampusBattle Hall, also known as ""The Old
Library"", was added to the National
Register of Historic Places in 1970.The University of Texas at Austin has an extensive tunne l system that links the buildings on campus.
Constructed c. 1928  under the supervision of UT engineering professor Carl J. Eckhardt Jr., then head of
the phys ical plant, the tunne ls have grown along with the campus.[95] They measure approximately six
miles in length.[96][97] The tunne l system is used for communications and utility service. It is closed to the
public and guarded by silent alarms. Since the late 1940s , the university has generated its own electricity.
Today its natural gas cogeneration plant has a capacity of 123 MW. The university also operates a TRIGA
nuclear reactor at the J. J. Pickle Research Campus.[98][99]
The university continues to expand its facilities on campus. In 2010, the university opened the state-of-the-
art Norman Hackerman building (on the site of the former Experimental Sciences Building) housing
chemistry and biology research and teaching laboratories. In 2010, the university broke ground on the
$120 million Bill & Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex and Dell Computer Science Hall and the
$51 million Belo Center for New Media, both of which are now complete.[100][101] The new LEED gold-
certified, 110,000- square-foot (10,000 m2) Student Activity Center (SAC) opened in January 2011, housing
study rooms, lounge s and food vendors. The SAC was constructed as a result of a student referendum
passed in 2006 which raised student fees by $65 per semester.[102] In 2012, the Moody Founda tion
awarded the College of Communication $50 million, the largest endow ment any communication college
has received, so naming it the Moody C ollege of Communication.
The university operates two public radio stations, KUT with news and information, and KUTX with music,
via local FM broadcasts as well as live streaming audio over the Internet. The university uses CapMetro to
provide bus transportation for students around the campus on the UT Shuttle system and throughout  Austin,
and UT students, faculty, and staff with an active UT ID card are able to ride public transportation without
paying a fare.[103]
The university contains eighteen colleges and schools and one

The University of Texas at Austin offers more than 100
unde rgraduate and 170 graduate degrees. In the 2009–2010
academic year, the university awarded a total of 13,215 degrees:
67.7%  bachelor's degrees, 22.0%  master's degrees, 6.4%  doctoral
degrees, and 3.9%  Professional degrees.[105]
In addition, the university has nine honor s programs, eight of which
span a variety of academic fields: Liberal Arts Honors, the Business
Honors Program, the Turing Scholars Program in Computer
Science, Engineering Honors, the Dean's Scholars Program in
Natural Sciences, the Health Science Scholars Program in Natural
Sciences, the Polymathic Scholars Program in Natural Sciences, and the Undergraduate Nursing Honors
Program in School of Nursing. The ninth is the Plan II Honors Program, a rigorous interdisciplinary
program that is a major in and of itself.[106] Many Plan II students pursue a second major, often
participating in another department's honors program in addition to Plan II.[107] The university also offers
programs such as the Freshman Research Initiative and Texas Interdisciplinary Plan.[108]
The University of Texas at Austin encourages applicants to submit
SAT/ACT scores, but it is not required.[111] However, for students
applying for admission from Fall 2025 onwards, submission of
SAT/ACT scores is mandatory as part of their unde rgraduate
admission application. [112] As of 2011, the university was one of
the most selective universities in the region. Relative to other
universities in the state of Texas, UT Austin was second to Rice
University in selectivity according to a Business Journal study
weighing acceptance rates and the mid-range of the SAT and ACT.
The University of Texas at Austin was ranked as the 18th most
selective in the South.[113]
As a state public university, UT Austin was subject to Texas House
Bill 588, which guaranteed Texas high school seniors graduating in
the top 10% of their class admission to any public Texas university.
A new state law granting UT Austin (but no other state university)
a partial exemption from the top 10% rule, Senate Bill 175, was
passed by the 81st Legislature in 2009. It modified this admissions policy by limiting automatically admitted
freshmen to 75% of the entering in-state freshman class, starting in 2011. The university will admit the top
one percent, the top two percent and so forth until the cap is reached; the university currently admits the topAcademics

For others who go through the traditional application process, selectivity is deemed ""more selective""
according to the Carnegie Founda tion for the Advancement of Teaching and by U.S. News & World

45.2%  enrolled.[118] Among freshman students who enrolled in Fall 2017, SAT scores for the middle 50%
ranged from 570 to 690 for critical reading and 600–710 for math.[118] ACT composite scores for the
middle 50% ranged from 26 to 31.[118] In terms of class rank, 74.4%  of enrolled freshmen were in the top

respectively.[136][137] More than 50 other science, humanities, and professional programs rank in the top 25
nationally.[138] The College of Pharmacy is listed as the third-best in the nation and The School of
Information (iSchool) is sixth-best in Library and Information Sciences.[138] Among other rankings, the
School of Social Work is 7th, the Jackson School of Geosciences is 8th for Earth Sciences, the Cockrell
School of Engineering is tied for 10th-best (with the unde rgraduate engineering program tied for 11th-best
in the country), the Nursing School is tied for 13th, the University of Texas School of Law is 15th, the
Lyndon B. Johns on School of Public Affairs is 7th, and the McCombs School of Business is tied for 16th-
best (with the unde rgraduate business program tied for 5th-best in the country).[138]
The University of Texas School of Architecture was ranked second
among na tional unde rgraduate programs in 2012.[139]
A 2005 Bloomberg survey ranked the school 5th among all
business schools and first among public business schools for the
largest number of alumni who are S&P 500 CEOs.[140] Similarly, a
2005 USA Today report ranked the university as ""the number one
source of new Fortune 1000  CEOs"".[141] A ""payback"" analysis
published by SmartMoney in 2011 comparing graduates' salaries to
tuition costs concluded the school was the second-best value of all
colleges in the nation, behind only Georgia Tech.[142] A 2013
College Database study found that UT Austin was 22nd in the
nation in terms of increased lifetime earnings by gr aduates.[143]
UT Austin is classified among ""R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity.""[117] For the 2014–
2015 cycle, the university was awarded over $580 million in sponsored projects,[144][145] and has earned
more than 300 patents since 2003.[146] The University of Texas at Austin hous es the Office of Technology
Commercialization, a  technology t ransfer center which serves as the bridge between laboratory research and
commercial development. In 2009, the university created nine new start-up companies to commercialize
technology developed at the university and has created 46 start-ups in the past seven years. License
agreements generated $10.9 million in revenue for the university in 2009.[146] In January 2020, the
University of Texas Austin's Texas Innova tion C enter was established to provide suppor t for startups.[147]ResearchThe Engineering Education and
Research Center (EERC), a
multidisciplinary teaching and
research facility for the Cockrell
School of EngineeringResearch at UT Austin is largely focused in the engineering and
phys ical sciences,[148] and the university is a world-leading
research institution in fields such as computer science.[149] Energy
is a major research thrust, with federally funde d projects on
biofuels,[150] battery and solar cell technology, and geological
carbon dioxide storage,[151] water purification membranes, among
others. In 2009, the University of Texas founde d the Energy
Institute, led by former Under Secretary for Science Raymond L.
Orbach, to organize and advance multi-disciplinary energy
research.[152] In addition to its own medical school, it hous es
medical programs associated with other campuses and allied health
professional programs, as well as major research programs in
pharmacy, biomedical engineering, ne uroscience, and ot hers.
In 2010, the University of Texas at Austin opened the $100 million Dell Pediatric Research Institute to
increase medical research at the university and establish a medical research complex, and associated medical
school, in Austin.[153][154]
The university operates several major auxiliary research centers. The world's third-largest telescope, the
Hobby–E berly Telescope, and three other large telescopes are part of the university's McDonald
Observatory, 450 miles (720 km) west of Austin.[155][156] The university manages nearly 300 acres
(120 ha) of biological field laboratories, including the Brackenridge Field Laboratory in Austin. The Center
for Agile Technology focuses on software development challenges.[157] The J.J. Pickle Research Campus
(PRC) is home to the Texas Advanced Computing Center which operates a series of supercomputers, such
as Ranger (from 2008 to 2013 [158]), Stampede (2013–2017 [159]), Stampede2 (since 2017 [160]), and
Frontera (since 2019) .[161] The Pickle campus also hosts the Microelectronics Research Center which
hous es micro- and nanoelectronics research and features a 15,000 square foot (1,400 m2) cleanroom for
device fabrication.
Founde d in 1946, the university's Applied Research Laboratories at the PRC has developed or tested the
vast majority of the Navy's high-frequency sonar equipment. In 2007, the Navy granted it a research
contract funde d up to $928 million over ten years.[162][163] The Institute for Advanced Technology,
founde d in 1990 and located in the West Pickle Research Building, suppor ts the U.S. Army with basic and
applied research in several fields.
The Center for Transportation Research is a nationally recognized research institution focusing on
transportation research, education, and public service. Established in 1963 as the Center for Highway
Research, its projects address virtually all aspects of transportation, including econom ics, multimodal
systems, traffic conge stion relief, transportation policy, materials, structures, transit, environmental impacts,
driver behavior, land us e, geometric design, a ccessibility, and pa vements.[164]
In 2013, the University of Texas at Austin announc ed the naming of the O'Donne ll Building for Applied
Computational Engineering and Sciences. The O'Donne ll Founda tion of  Dallas, headed by Peter O'Donne ll
and his wife, Edith Jones O'Donne ll, has given more than $135 million to the university between 1983 and
2013. University president William C. Powers declared the O'Donne lls ""among the greatest suppor ters of
the University of Texas in its 130-year history. Their transformative generosity is based on the belief in our
power to change society for the better.""[165] In 2008, O'Donne ll pledged $18 million to finance the hiringThe Norman Hackerman Buildingof university faculty members unde rtaking research in mathematics, computers, and multiple scientific
disciplines; his pledge was matched by W. A. ""Tex"" Moncrief Jr., an oilman and philanthropist from Fort
Worth.[166] In addition, U T Austin and Amazon established a new science hub i n 2023. [167] [168]
The University of Texas at Austin Marine Science Institute is located on the Gulf coast in Port Aransas.
Established in 1941, UTMSI was the first permanent marine research facility in the state of Texas and has
since contributed significantly to our understanding of marine ecosystems. Research at the Marine Science
Institute ranges from locally-important work on mariculture and estuarine ecosystems to the investigation of
global issues in marine science, from the Arctic to the tropics.
The University of Texas System is entitled to at least 30% of the
distributions from the Permanent University Fund (PUF), with over
$33 billion in assets as of year-end 2021.[169][170] The University
of Texas System gets two-thirds of the Available University Fund
(the name of the annua l distribution of PUF's income), and the
Texas A&M University System gets the other third. A regental
policy[171] requires at least 45 percent of UT System's share of this
money go to the University of Texas at Austin for ""program
enrichment"". By taking two-thirds and multiplying it by 45 percent,
UT gets 30 percent, which is the minimum amount of AUF income
that can be distributed to the school unde r current policies. The Regents, however, can decide to allocate
additional amounts to the university. Also, the majority of the University of Texas system share of the AUF
is used for its debt service bonds , some of which were issued for the benefit of the Austin campus.[172] The
Regents can change the 45 percent minimum of the University of Texas System share that goes to the
Austin campus at any time, although doi ng so might be difficult politically.
Proceeds from lands appropriated in 1839 and 1876, as well as oil monies, comprise the majority of PUF.
At one time, the PUF was the chief source of income for Texas' two university systems, the University of
Texas System and the Texas A&M University System; today, however, its revenues account for less than 10
percent of the universities' annua l budge ts. This has challenged the universities to increase spons ored
research and private dona tions. Privately funde d endow ments contribute over $2 billion to the university's
total endow ment.
The University of Texas System also has about $22 bi llion of  assets in its General Endow ment Fund.[173]
For Fall 2023, the university enrolled 42,444 unde rgraduate students and 9,469 graduate students, bringing
the total student count to 51,913. Out-of-state students accounted for 10% of the unde rgraduate student
body , and international students comprised 9.6%  of the total student body .[175] Out-of-state and
international students comprised 9.1%  of the unde rgraduate student body and 20.1%  of the total student
body , with students from all 50 states and more than 120 foreign countries—most notably, the Republic of
Korea, followed by t he People's Republic of China, India, Mexico, and Taiwan.[176]Endowment

The campus has fourteen residence halls, the
newest of which opened in Spring 2007. As of
2024, there are a total of fifteen on-campus
residence halls, with eight located in North Campus and seven in South Campus.[179] Residence Hall Rates
for the 2024–25 Fall and Spring Terms vary across eleven different rates, ranging from the lowest rate of
$13,504 to the highest rate of $20,447, each correspondi ng to different room types.[180] On-campus
hous ing can hold more than 7,100 students.[181] Jester Center is the largest residence hall with its capacity
of 2,945.[182] Academic enrollment exceeds the on-campus hous ing capacity; as a result, most students
must live in private residence halls, hous ing coope ratives, apartments, or with Greek organizations and
other off-campus residences. University Housing and Dining, which already has the largest market share of
7,000 of  the estimated 27,000 be ds in the campus area, plans to expand to 9,000 be ds.[183]
The University of Texas at Austin is home to an active Greek community. Approximately 14 percent of
unde rgraduate students are in fraternities or sororities.[184] With more than 65 national chapters, the
university's Greek community is one of the nation's largest.[184] These chapters are unde r the authority of
one of the school's six Greek counc il communities, Interfraternity Counc il, National Pan-Hellenic Counc il,
Texas Asian Pan-Hellenic Counc il, Latino Pan-Hellenic Counc il, Multicultural Greek Counc il and
University Panhellenic Counc il.[185] Other registered student organizations also name themselves with
Greek letters and are called affiliates. They are not a part of one of the six counc ils but have all of the same
privileges and respons ibilities of any other organization.[186] Most Greek houses are west of the Drag in the
West Campus neighbor hood.
Students express their opinions in and out of class through periodicals including Study Breaks magazine,
Longhor n Life, The Daily Texan (the most award-winning daily college newspaper in the United
States),[187] and the Texas Travesty. Over the airwaves students' voices are heard through Texas Student
Television (K29HW-D) and KVRX Radio.Residential life

Traditions at the University of Texas are perpetuated through
several school symbols and mediums. At athletic events, students
frequently sing ""Texas Fight"", the university's fight song[189] while
displaying the Hook 'em Horns hand gesture[190]—the gesture
mimicking the horns of the school's mascot, Bevo the Texas
Longhor n.
The University of Texas offers a wide variety of varsity and
intramural sports programs.
The university's men's and women's athletics teams are nicknamed
the Longhor ns. Texas has won 50 total national
championships,[191] 42 of which are NCAA national
championships.[192]
The football team experienced its greatest success unde r coach
Darrell Royal, winning three national championships in 1963,
1969, and 1970. It won a fourth title unde r head coach Mack
Brown in 2005 after a 41–38 victory over previously unde feated
Southern California in the 2006 R ose Bowl.
The university's baseball team has made more trips to the College
World Series (35) than any other school, and won championships in 1949, 1950, 1975, 1983, 2002, and
2005.[193]
The Texas Longhor ns men’s basketball has qualified for the NCAA Final Four three times and achieved 28
conference championships and 38 t otal appearances in the NCAA tournament. [194]
Rick Barnes led the Texas Longhor ns men's basketball from 1998 to 2015. Under his leadership, the team
achieved 16 N CAA Tournament appearances, including a Final Four appearance in 2003. [195]
Shaka Smart coached the Texas Longhor ns men's basketball from 2015 to 2021. While at UT Austin,
Smart's teams made 3 NCAA Tournament appearances. [196]
Additionally, the university's men's and women's swimming and diving teams lay claim to sixteen NCAA
Division I titles, with the men's team having 13 of those titles, more than any other Division 1 team.[197]
The swim team was first developed unde r Coach Tex Robertson.[198]Traditions
Athletics
Varsity sportsOn June 12, 2020, UT student-athletes banded together with their #WeAreOne statement on Twitter.
Among the list of changes included: renaming certain campus buildings, replacing statues, starting outreach
programs, and replacing ""The Eyes of Texas"". UT Interim President Jay Hartzell released a statement on
July 13, 2020, announc ing the changes to be implemented in light of these demands from UT student-
athletes. Hartzell said the university would make a multi-million dollar investment to programs that recruit,
retain and suppor t Black students; rename the Robert L. Moore Building as the Physics, Math and
Astronom y Building; honor  Heman M. Sweatt in numerous ways, including placing a statue of Sweatt near
the entrance of  T.S. Painter Hall; honor  the Precursors, the first Black unde rgraduates to attend the
University of Texas at Austin, by commissioning a new monum ent on the East Mall; erect a statue for Julius
Whittier, the Longhor ns' first Black football letterman, at DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium; and more.
However, one of the most controversial topics on the list – replacing ""The Eyes of Texas"" as UT's alma
mater – remained unt ouched.[199]
